# MapDistanceFix

A very simple Minecraft Fabric mod that fixes map player indicators to always show the player's position and direction, even when outside map boundaries, making it much easier to navigate treasure maps and other map items.

## üéØ Why This Mod?

In vanilla Minecraft, when you're far from a map's boundaries, the player indicator either disappears entirely or shows as a generic "player_off_map" and "player_off_limits" decorations without directional information. This mod fixes that by:

1. Converting off-map player decorations to regular player decorations
2. Maintaining correct rotation to show which direction you're facing
3.  Ensuring the player is always visible for better navigation (Does not work with normal maps. Only treasure and explorer maps. Due to vanilla limitation, the player icon disappears if you are far away on normal maps.)

## üì¶ Installation

### Requirements

## üîÑ Compatibility

- **Multiplayer**: Compatible with multiplayer environments
- **Other Mods**: Should be compatible with most other mods that don't heavily modify map rendering

## ‚ö° Performance
